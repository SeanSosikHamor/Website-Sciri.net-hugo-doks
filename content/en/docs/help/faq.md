## What does Sciri mean?

In the late eighties, Sean used Scirocco as his Internet Relay Chat (IRC) nickname and hacker handle. Once he joined EFNet in the early nineties, which didn't utilize NickServ, a battle over the Scirocco nickname ensued.

A college student from Scandinavia had laid unofficial claim to the nickname, and she used the greater bandwidth of her college dorm room connection to constantly ping flood Sean offline. This allowed her to grab the Scirocco nickname at her leisure.   

So Sciri was chosen as a made-up word that sounded similar to Scirocco.
